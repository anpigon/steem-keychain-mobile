Steem Keychain lets you handle all your Steem related operations from your mobile! Your keys are kept safe by a combination of encryption by pin code and biometrics (fingerprint).

From the App, you can import your accounts via your private keys or QR code. You will then get access to your accounts main information such as SP, balances, Steem Engine tokens, delegations and transaction history.

It also lets you handle Steem operations while keeping your keys safe. You can broadcast your transfers, delegations and power up/down, as well as Steem Engine operations.

The app is entirely opensource and its source code can be found on Github:
